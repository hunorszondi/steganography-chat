# Steganography chat

The communication between people has always been a must. This is the base of our society for
hundreds of years. There were several revolutions when the form of communication radically changed,
like when the human became capable to create patterns with its voice or when got the idea to store
the shared information in written form. In our modern world the communication became much more
complicated than preserving some text on a paper. Nowadays almost all the information on the world is
stored as binary data, mostly on a public platform, on the internet. This amazing infrastructure connects
the people, stores and serves data. The only problem here is the public property of the internet, because
anyone who has the knowledge to handle the system, has access to any kind of data. But fortunately we
have cryptography which helps in managing restrictions, keeping our data safe from third parties.
But what if we want to hide the data in a way that no one could discover it? Steganography is the
solution. This is a technique to hide data in some other data like photo or audio files. The LetStego
application brings a unique implementation of a method used in steganography. It is a chat application
for Android devices, able to send and receive images, storing hidden data in an encrypted form in a
modern, user-friendly environment. It is not just useful in some situations, but in general it gives a little
power to the users, gives the opportunity to communicate through a very secure and hidden channel.
This work is the result of my own activity. I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance
on this work.
